# Week6-Documentation

# Documentation

* Documentation is critically important throughout programming and software development:

  * For understanding code written by others

    理解其他人写的代码
  * For enabling others to understand code written by you

    帮助别人理解自己的代码
  * To enable end users to use the software you produce

    使最终用户可以使用软件
  * To understand what a customer or manager is asking you to do

    理解客户和经理的需求
  * To give instructions to other members of a programming or testing team

    给编程或测试团队的其他成员提供指导

# Tools for documentation

* Regular word processors such as Microsoft Word, Apple Pages, OpenOffice, etc are perfectly adequate for documenting software

* Some software makes use of standard diagrams for which specific software exists such as Microsoft Visio, SmartDraw or StarUML

* Some programmers prefer to use alternative formats for technical documentation:

  * **HTML**: can display in any web browser, but can be more awkward to write and maintain
  * **Markdown**: a plain-text base format with symbolic conventions for layout, turned into PDF or HTML by a free markdown processor
  * **LaTeX**: a free document processor with its own text format and an inbuilt programming language for extensibility; hard to learn but has strong support for maths, diagrams, and complex layouts. Usually used together with a LaTeX specific editor such as TeXworks

# Comments in Programs

* All programming languages support comments: text which is included in the program for humans to read, and ignored by the computer

* Adding comments to your code can help other programmers read and understand it

* They can also be valuable for you when you come back to code you have written in the past

* Make sure that comments provide context, explanation or meaning of the code – don’t just restate what the code says

* If you develop algorithms using stepwise refinement, the higher levels can give you an idea of useful comments
