# How IDEs help you

•Both editors try to help you enter code in the correct syntax

•For example, if you enter an open bracket (, both IDEs automatically fill in a close bracket ) beyond your cursor at the end of the line to ensure you don’t forget to close the bracket. IntelliJ does the same with braces {}.

•Both will also highlight the matching brace or bracket when you type one or move your cursor over one, which can be used to easily see code blocks. If a bracket appears red, it has no match

•Both editors also try to save you needing to remember things

•Starting to type a class or package name (like System) will bring up a list of the contents of that class or package after a pause (or you can force it by pressing Ctrl+Space), and also display the documentation for each of those parts (although this may take a little while to load)

•Both systems try to scan your code for errors as you type

•The coloured bar on the right of the editor shows where it may have found problems

•Red lights mean a serious error which will stop your program running or surely result in odd behaviour

•Yellow lights means code that could be better laid out or written more efficiently. IntelliJ is better at this kind of detection than NetBeans, but it can take longer to complete detection

•You can trigger a more in‐depth analysis of your code by choosing Refactor > Inspect and Transform (Netbeans) or Analyze > Inspect Code (IntelliJ)
